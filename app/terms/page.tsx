          These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your access to and use of TLDW (&ldquo;we&rdquo;,
          &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;). By creating an account or using the product, you agree to these

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-[#3f3f3f]">Account &amp; Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          You are responsible for maintaining the security of your TLDW account and the credentials associated with it.
          You must provide accurate information when you sign up and keep your contact details up to date so we can send
          important notices about your subscription.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-[#3f3f3f]">Subscriptions &amp; Billing</h2>
        <p>
          TLDW offers both free access and paid Pro subscriptions that deliver additional features and higher usage
          limits. When you activate a paid plan, Stripe securely processes your payment information on our behalf. You
          authorize us to charge the applicable subscription fees (and any related taxes) at the start of each billing
          period until you cancel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise stated during checkout, subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing cycle.
          If we update our pricing, we will notify you in advance and give you a chance to cancel before the change
          takes effect.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-[#3f3f3f]">Annual Pro Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We offer a full refund on the annual Pro subscription if you cancel within 48 hours of the initial purchase.
          To qualify:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>The refund request must be submitted within 48 hours of your annual upgrade.</li>
          <li>The request must come from the account holder or the billing contact on file.</li>
          <li>Only the first annual charge in a given subscription term is eligible; renewals are not covered.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To request a refund, email us at{' '}
          <a className="font-medium text-[#3f3f3f] underline underline-offset-4" href={`mailto:${supportEmail}`}>
            {supportEmail}
          </a>{' '}
          with your account email and Stripe receipt. Once approved, refunds are processed through Stripe and typically
          appear on your statement within 5&ndash;10 business days. Beyond this 48-hour window, refunds are handled at
          our discretion and are generally not issued for partial periods.

      <section className="space-y-4">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-[#3f3f3f]">Cancellation</h2>
        <p>
          You can cancel your subscription at any time from your TLDW account settings. Navigate to{' '}
          <Link className="font-medium text-[#3f3f3f] underline underline-offset-4" href="/settings">
            Settings &rarr; Manage billing
          </Link>{' '}
          to open the Stripe customer portal, where you can cancel effective at the end of your current billing cycle.

      <section className="space-y-4">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-[#3f3f3f]">Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>
          You agree not to misuse TLDW, interfere with other users, or attempt to access the service using automated
          scripts at a rate that would degrade performance. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these
          Terms or applicable law.

          We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you via email or an
          in-app message and indicate the effective date. Your continued use of TLDW after the update becomes effective
          means you accept the revised Terms.
